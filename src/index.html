        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <span></span>
        <p>My journey into programming began with Python, which I discovered through self-study during my Senior High School years in the STEM program. Despite programming not being part of our curriculum, my fascination with technology drove me to explore it independently.</p>
        <p>What captured me most was the power of automation and scripting—the ability to leverage computers to streamline everyday tasks. Programming became addictive; the immediate feedback loop when solving problems was intensely satisfying. This passion truly flourished when I entered college as an Information Systems student at the Technological University of the Philippines - Manila.</p>
        <p>My programming interests have led me down various paths. I've developed plugins for custom Minecraft servers, creating enhanced gaming experiences for my friends and me. I've also immersed myself in the Linux ecosystem and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community, where I found kindred spirits who share my enthusiasm for open technology.</p>
        <p>The UNIX philosophy—"Do one thing and do it well"—has become my daily mantra. Currently, I'm expanding my skillset with ReactJS for web development, while keeping my horizons broad. I'm particularly drawn to three domains: Web Development, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics, where I see endless possibilities for innovation and growth.</p>
